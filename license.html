<h1 id="markdown-monster-license">Markdown Monster License</h1>
<p>Markdown Monster comes in several license modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Single User</li>
<li>Multiple User</li>
<li>Site License.</li>
</ul>
<p>Markdown Monster is a licensed product that requires a paid-for
license for continued use. The software is licensed as <em>© Rick
Strahl, West Wind Technologies, 2015-2022</em>.</p>
<p>A fully functional, free evaluation version is available for
evaluation use, but continued use requires purchase of a license.</p>
<p>Licenses can be purchased from:<br />
https://store.west-wind.com/product/markdown_monster</p>
<h4 id="evaluation-license">Evaluation License</h4>
<p>The Evaluation version has all the features and functionality of the
registered version, except that it shows occasional freeware notices.
Tampering with or removing of the notices is not allowed with the
evaluation license.</p>
<p>You can use the evaluation version with the notices enabled, but if
you use Markdown Monster regularly or for commercial use, please
register and support further development and maintenance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT: Licenses are activated and occasionally re-validated over
the Internet, so an <strong>Internet connection is required</strong> for
using Markdown Monster in licensed mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="purchased-license">Purchased License</h4>
<p>For continued use or commercial use of Markdown Monster a paid-for
license is required. The paid-for license removes the freeware
notices.</p>
<p>Each licensed user must have a separate license, but a single user
may use multiple copies of Markdown Monster on multiple machines.</p>
<p>The multi-user licenses work the same as a single user license
applied to the number of users specified on the license purchased. An
organizational site license is available to allow any number of users
running unlimited numbers of Markdown Monster instances within a single
commercial, non-profit or government organization.</p>
<p>Any purchased license is valid for the duration of the major release
that it was purchased for (ie. 1.00-1.99) and minor version updates
within that major version are always free. Upgrade pricing is available
for major version upgrades, usually at half of full price, and it’s our
policy to allow for free upgrades to the next major version within a
year of purchase.</p>
<h4 id="SourceCode">Source Code</h4>
<p>Due to rampant abuse of the original publicly accessible repository,
public source code access is no longer available. Markdown Monster
source code is now available on a <strong>per request basis in a private
GitHub repository</strong> and you can request access to the private
repository.</p>
<p>Licensing outlined above applies to the source code. We allow for
modification of source code only for internal use of Markdown Monster in
your organization or for submitting pull requests to the Markdown
Monster main repository.</p>
<p><strong><em>Under no circumstances are you allowed to re-package or
re-distribute any part of Markdown Monster outside of your
organization.</em></strong></p>
<p>To request access for the private repository please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a GitHub email address</li>
<li>A brief note what you plan to use access for</li>
<li>Send the request to <code>markdownmonster@@west-wind.com</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Access to the repository is by our discretion.</p>
<h4 id="Contribute">Contribute - Get a Free License</h4>
<p>Contributors that provide valuable feedback with <a
href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/MarkdownMonster/issues">quality bug
reports or enhancement requests</a>, help out with code via Pull
Requests, help promote Markdown Monster, or support Markdown Monster in
any other significant way are all eligible for a free license.</p>
<p><a href="http://west-wind.com/contact/" target="top">Contact Rick for
more info</a> or - just as likely - I’ll be contacting you.</p>
